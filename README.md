# AI Event Trader

## Background

Cryptocurrency markets are highly responsive to social media statements from influential figures like Vitalik Buterin or Donald Trump. For instance, on April 3, 2025, when Justin Sun criticized FUSDT, it triggered significant de-pegging. However, once the FUSDT team provided clarification, the price quickly returned to its pegged value. This volatility creates substantial arbitrage opportunities for traders who can quickly react to key opinion leaders' (KOLs) statements.

The challenge is that a single person cannot effectively monitor all relevant KOLs across various platforms, leading to missed trading opportunities.

## Introduction
